Initial Plans:
This project will be a comprehensive look at how well we can predict player season statistics based on the information on nba.com . We will start with a scraper to retrieve data from nba.com. The scraper will retrieve seasonal player data. The data will be organised into a class format that is accessible and simple to manipulate. Once we have acquired the data we will investigate how various machine learning techniques can be used to interpret the data and predict player data for next year.

Further Plans:
Can we predict individual player performance? We will focus on one player through the 2017-2018 nba season and use the results from our initial project as well as more ML to see how well we can predict their game to game performance throughout the season.
